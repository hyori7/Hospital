			<p>The Townsville Children's Hospital (TCH) Townsville is one of the Australia's 
                best children's hospitals. We are the major specialist paediatric hospital in 
                Townsville and our care extends to children from Queensland, Norhtern Territory 
                and other states around Australia and overseas.</p>
 
<p>With a passionate, highly skilled and committed staff campus wide of close to 1, 
    000 we provide a full range of clinical services, tertiary care and health 
    promotion and prevention programs for children and young people. </p>
 
<p>We are the designated statewide major trauma centre for paediatrics in North 
    Queensland and a Nationally Funded Centre for cardiac and liver transplantation. 
    When it comes to training and research we partner with the very best. Our campus 
    partners the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute (MCRI) and The University of 
    Queensland are on site with the hospital in West End.</p>
<p>
    Established in 1970 and located on our present site at West End in Townsvile, 
    Australia since 1980, we are now entering a very exciting time in our history, 
    with the Queensland Government building a brand new hospital right next door to 
    our current site in West End.</p>
